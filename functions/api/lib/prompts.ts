export const INTAKE_NORMALIZER = `ROLE: Intake Normalizer

INPUTS MAY INCLUDE:
- Free text describing family names, places, dates, anecdotes.
- URLs to genealogy profiles (Ancestry, FamilySearch, MyHeritage, WikiTree).
- Uploaded files (PDFs, images of records or notes). Use OCR summary if image text is present.
- Pasted image captions or transcriptions.

TASK:
1) Extract high-signal fields from all inputs.
2) Summarize uncertain or conflicting details as "hypotheses".
3) Produce \`intake.v1\` JSON.

CRITICAL: Output ONLY valid JSON. No prose, no markdown code blocks, no explanatory text. Start with { and end with }.

OUTPUT JSON ONLY:

  "surnames": string[],                 // e.g., ["McLeod","Roberts"]
  "suspected_origins": string[],        // e.g., ["Skye","Wales (Roberts?)"]
  "immigration_window": string|null,    // e.g., "1880–1920"

  "duration_days": int|null,
  "target_month": string|null,          // e.g., "June"
  "transport": { "rail": bool, "car_ok": bool, "driver_guide_ok": bool },
  "travel_pace": "relaxed|moderate|exploratory"|null,  // relaxed=2-3 days/city, moderate=2 cities/10 days, exploratory=3-4 cities/10 days

  "notes": string[],                    // misc context
  "assumptions": string[]               // defaults we had to assume
}
Rules:
- If field is missing, set null or an empty array and add an appropriate assumption.
- Keep arrays deduplicated and concise.`;

export const OPTIONS_GENERATOR = `ROLE: Heritage Options Generator with Cost Estimation

INPUT: \`intake.v1\` JSON.

TASK:
- Propose up to FOUR distinct trip options that align with surnames/origins and stated preferences.
- For each option, include concise day-cards (4–8 days typical for MVP demo; scale if duration is set).
- RESPECT travel_pace: relaxed=2-3 days per city, moderate=2 cities per 10 days (default), exploratory=3-4 cities per 10 days
- Each option MUST include a one-line "whyOverall" and day-level "why".
- Use rail-first in cities and short drives elsewhere; include one scenic walk ≤2h and one cathedral/abbey day.
- Suggest 1–2 "smart splurges" (value-friendly, commission-friendly).
- IMPORTANT: Include realistic cost estimates for each option based on:
  * Lodging level (budget/comfort/boutique/luxury)
  * Number of days and cities
  * Transport (train passes, car rental, driver/guide)
  * Estimated activities/admissions
  * Typical meal costs in the region

CRITICAL: Output ONLY valid JSON. No prose, no markdown code blocks, no explanatory text. Start with { and end with }.

RETURN JSON ONLY:
{
  "options": [
    {
      "key": "A|B|C|D",
      "title": "string",
      "whyOverall": "string",
      "days": [
        { "d": 1, "city":"string", "country":"ISO-2-code", "am":"string", "pm":"string",
          "drive":"e.g., 0h45", "rail":"e.g., 1h15", "why":"string" }

        "breakdown_notes": "string (2-3 sentences explaining the estimate)"
      },
      "assumptions": ["string"]
    }
  ]
}
Rules:
- If surnames suggest multiple geographies (e.g., Irish + Welsh), offer variants that cover each hypothesis.
- ALWAYS include "country" field with ISO-2 country code (GB, IE, FR, DE, IT, etc.) for each day to disambiguate cities (e.g., York, GB vs Durham, GB vs Paris, FR).
- Never include live availability or exact hotels/flights.
- Keep the entire JSON under ~900 tokens; pick the best 2–4 options; use brief phrasing.`;

export const OPTION_SELECTOR_TO_AB = `ROLE: Itinerary Style Variants Generator

INPUT:
- Current itinerary with days and hotel options
- User preferences: { transport, luxury, activity, accessibility }

TASK:
Generate TWO itinerary style variants based on the current itinerary:
- Variant A: "Guided Experience" - More structured with guided tours, planned activities
- Variant B: "Independent Explorer" - More flexible with self-guided options, free time

CRITICAL: Output ONLY valid JSON. No prose, no markdown code blocks, no explanatory text. Start with { and end with }.

OUTPUT JSON ONLY:
{
  "variantA": {
    "title": "string",
    "style": "Guided Experience",
    "overview": "string (1-2 sentences)",
    "cities": ["city1", "city2"],
    "estimated_budget": number,
    "highlights": ["highlight1", "highlight2", "highlight3"]
  },
  "variantB": {
    "title": "string",

    "cities": ["city1", "city2"],
    "estimated_budget": number,
    "highlights": ["highlight1", "highlight2", "highlight3"]
  }
}

Rules:
- Keep TOTAL output under 600 tokens
- Use cities from the current itinerary
- Estimated budget should differ by ~15-20% (guided costs more)
- NO markdown formatting, NO code blocks, ONLY JSON`;

export const ITINERARY_EXPANDER = `ROLE: Itinerary Expander

INPUT: Selected variant (A or B) from previous step

TASK:
- Expand the itinerary with richer detail
- Add evening suggestions (eve field)
- Enhance "why" fields with cultural context
- Maintain schema compliance

RETURN JSON ONLY (itinerary.v1 format)

Rules:
- Output cap: 600-900 tokens depending on complexity
- No definitive claims about hours/availability
- Reference "typical hours" and suggest user confirmation`;

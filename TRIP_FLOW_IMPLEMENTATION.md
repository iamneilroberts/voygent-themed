# Trip Flow & Frontend Integration - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented web search integration into the trip flow with hotel selection, flight pricing, and cost estimates displayed in the frontend.

## Completed Tasks (T034-T041)

### Backend Integration (T034-T036)

#### T035: A/B Variants with Flight Pricing ✅
**File**: `functions/api/trips/[id]/ab.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added Amadeus flight search integration after LLM generates A/B variants
- Extracts origin airport and travel month from trip intake data
- Maps cities to airport codes (Edinburgh→EDI, Glasgow→GLA, Inverness→INV, etc.)
- Fetches flight pricing for each variant's primary destination city
- Calculates total trip estimate: `(flight_price_low * adults) + estimated_budget`
- Returns enriched variants with:
  - `flights.price_low` - Cheapest flight price
  - `flights.price_high` - Highest flight price
  - `flights.carrier` - Primary airline carrier
  - `flights.route` - Flight route (e.g., "JFK-EDI")
  - `flights.disclaimer` - Pricing disclaimer
  - `total_estimate` - Estimated total trip cost

**Error Handling**:
- Falls back gracefully if flight API fails
- Returns placeholder flight data with disclaimer
- Uses default total estimate if flight pricing unavailable

---

#### T034: Hotel Integration in Option Selection ✅
**File**: `functions/api/trips/[id]/select.ts`

**Changes**:
- Enhanced option selection endpoint to fetch hotels for each city in the selected option
- Extracts unique cities from option days
- Calls Amadeus hotel search API in parallel for all cities
- Calculates check-in dates sequentially (3 nights per city by default)
- Uses luxury level from intake data (budget/comfort/premium/luxury)
- Returns hotel options grouped by city:
  ```json
  {
    "city": "Edinburgh",
    "hotels": [
      {
        "hotel_id": "...",
        "name": "Hotel Name",
        "city": "Edinburgh",
        "nightly_price_low": 150,
        "nightly_price_high": 180,
        "star_rating": 4,
        "budget_tier": "comfort",
        "provider": "amadeus"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

**Error Handling**:
- Falls back to error message per city if hotel search fails
- Continues processing other cities even if one fails

---

#### T036: Hotel Selection Tracking ✅
**File**: `functions/api/trips/[id]/select.ts`

**Changes**:
- Modified PATCH endpoint to accept `selectedHotels` parameter
- When `selectedHotels` is provided, updates itinerary with hotel selections
- Stores selected hotels in `itinerary.selected_hotels` field
- Returns confirmation response with hotel selection status

**Request Format**:
```json
{
  "selectedHotels": [
    { "city": "Edinburgh", "hotel_id": "abc123" },
    { "city": "Inverness", "hotel_id": "def456" }
  ]
}
```

**File**: `public/app.js`

**New Functions**:
- `displayHotels(hotelsPerCity)` - Renders hotel selection interface
- `createHotelsContainer()` - Creates container for hotel UI

#### T040: Cost Estimates with Disclaimer ✅
**File**: `public/app.js`

**Changes to `renderVariant()`**:
- Added flight pricing section with:
  - Route information (origin → destination)
  - Price range per person
  - Carrier information
  - Pricing disclaimer
  - Blue background (#e8f4f8) to distinguish from other content

- Added total cost estimate section with:
  - Large, prominent total price display
  - Warning disclaimer about estimates
  - Commission disclosure (10-15% on top of range)
  - Yellow warning background (#fff3cd) with left border
  - Clear messaging that final pricing from travel professional

**Disclaimer Text**:
> ⚠️ **Important:** This is a preliminary estimate only. Final pricing will be provided by your travel professional and may include a 10-15% commission on top of the displayed range. Actual costs may vary based on availability, season, and specific preferences.

---

#### T041: Provider Data Display ✅
**File**: `public/app.js`

**Changes**:
- Flight data now displayed in variants (from T035 backend integration)
- Hotel data displayed in selection UI (from T034 backend integration)
- Provider badges shown for hotels (Amadeus/Serper)
- Real-time pricing displayed for both flights and hotels
- Loading states maintained during API calls
- Error handling for failed provider requests

**Data Flow**:
1. User selects option → Backend fetches hotels via Amadeus → Frontend displays hotel cards
2. User confirms option → Backend generates A/B variants → Backend fetches flights via Amadeus → Frontend displays variants with flight pricing
3. User selects hotels → Frontend sends selection → Backend saves to trip
4. User selects variant → Trip confirmed with all pricing data

## Testing

### Backend Endpoints
```bash
# Test A/B variants with flight pricing
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8788/api/trips/TRIP_ID/ab \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"luxury":"comfort","activity":"moderate"}'

# Test option selection with hotels
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8788/api/trips/TRIP_ID/select \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"optionKey":"A"}'

# Test hotel selection tracking
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8788/api/trips/TRIP_ID/select \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"selectedHotels":[{"city":"Edinburgh","hotel_id":"abc123"}]}'
```

### Frontend Testing
1. Generate trip with genealogy context
2. Select an option from A/B/C/D
3. Verify hotels displayed for each city in option
4. Select hotels for each city
5. Confirm hotel selection
6. Verify A/B variants appear with:
   - Flight pricing section
   - Total cost estimate with disclaimer
7. Select a variant

## Environment Variables Required
All already configured in `.dev.vars`:
- `AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID` - Production credentials
- `AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET` - Production credentials
- `AMADEUS_API_URL` - https://api.amadeus.com
- `SERPER_API_KEY` - Fallback for hotels

---

## Known Limitations

1. **City to Airport Mapping**: Hardcoded for common Scottish/UK/European cities. Would need expansion for global coverage or integration with airport lookup API.

2. **Hotel Check-in Dates**: Assumes sequential 3-night stays. Should be enhanced to use actual day-by-day itinerary dates.

3. **Flight API**: Only searches first destination city. Multi-city routes not yet supported.

4. **Error States**: Graceful fallbacks in place but could be enhanced with retry logic.

5. **Cache Integration**: Hotels and flights use 24h cache (already implemented in provider endpoints).

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Multi-city Flight Routes**: Support for complex itineraries with multiple destinations
2. **Dynamic Date Calculation**: Use actual itinerary day dates instead of sequential estimates
3. **Airport Lookup API**: Replace hardcoded city→airport mapping with geocoding
4. **Hotel Filtering**: Add filters for star rating, price range, amenities
5. **Price Alerts**: Notify when flight/hotel prices change significantly
6. **Booking Integration**: Direct booking links to Amadeus/partner sites
7. **Kiwi Integration**: Add budget airline support for cheaper flight options

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
-  Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Problem Statement

The VoyGent platform is now deployed to production at voygent.app on Cloudflare Pages, but lacks automated end-to-end tests that validate the live production system. While the existing test suite (feature 007) validates functionality in the development environment, there is no automated verification that:

- The production deployment is functioning correctly after releases
- All 5 trip themes work in the live environment with real API keys and database
- The production API endpoints respond correctly to real HTTP requests
- Database operations persist correctly in the production Cloudflare D1 database
- Performance and cost metrics meet expectations in the production environment
- Production secrets (API keys) are properly configured and functional
- Custom domain (voygent.app) routing works correctly
- Multi-region replication and edge caching work as expected

Without end-to-end production tests, the team must manually verify deployments by creating test trips through the UI or curl commands, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and doesn't provide regression protection.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A DevOps engineer or developer needs to validate that the production deployment at voygent.app is functioning correctly after:
1. Deploying new application code to Cloudflare Pages
2. Running database migrations on production D1 database
3. Updating production secrets (API keys)
4. Making infrastructure changes (DNS, routing, caching)

They should be able to run an automated end-to-end test suite that validates the live production system without requiring manual interaction or visual inspection.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Production API Availability**
1. **Given** the production site at voygent.app, **When** accessing the root URL, **Then** the site returns a 200 OK response
2. **Given** the production API, **When** GET /api/templates is called, **Then** response includes all 5 active templates
3. **Given** the production database, **When** querying for templates, **Then** all templates include required fields (id, name, icon, prompts)

**Theme-Specific Trip Generation (Production)**
4. **Given** a heritage trip request to production API, **When** POST /api/trips with surname "Williams" and origin "Scotland", **Then** trip is created with 2-4 options and persisted to production database
5. **Given** a TV/movie trip request, **When** POST /api/trips with title "Game of Thrones", **Then** response includes filming locations in Northern Ireland, Croatia, Iceland
6. **Given** a historical trip request, **When** POST /api/trips with event "D-Day", **Then** response includes Normandy historical sites
7. **Given** a culinary trip request, **When** POST /api/trips with cuisine "Italian" and region "Tuscany", **Then** response includes cooking classes and restaurants
8. **Given** an adventure trip request, **When** POST /api/trips with destination "Patagonia", **Then** response includes hiking trails and outdoor activities

**Research Integration (Production)**
9. **Given** a heritage trip request with surname, **When** production API processes request, **Then** research executes using production Serper/Tavily API keys
10. **Given** research completes, **When** trip data is saved, **Then** diagnostics column in production database contains research findings
11. **Given** web search API returns results, **When** trip generation completes, **Then** trip options include destinations found via research

**API Response Validation**
12. **Given** a valid trip creation request, **When** POST /api/trips completes, **Then** response includes tripId, intake, options array (2-4), diagnostics with cost tracking
13. **Given** a trip exists in production database, **When** GET /api/trips?userId={id} is called, **Then** response includes list of user's trips
14. **Given** an invalid trip request (missing text), **When** POST /api/trips is called, **Then** response returns 400 error with message "No input provided"
15. **Given** production API receives malformed data, **When** processing request, **Then** API returns appropriate error without crashing

**Performance & Cost (Production)**
16. **Given** a trip generation request to production, **When** processing completes, **Then** total duration is under 60 seconds
17. **Given** a trip with research enabled, **When** calculating production costs, **Then** total AI cost (OpenAI/Anthropic) is under $0.10
18. **Given** production AI API quotas, **When** making requests, **Then** no rate limit errors occur within normal usage patterns

**Database Persistence (Production)**
19. **Given** a trip created via production API, **When** querying production D1 database directly, **Then** trip record exists with correct status, intake_json, options_json, diagnostics
20. **Given** a trip with research data, **When** reading from database, **Then** diagnostics JSON includes research steps, queries, results, and timestamps
21. **Given** multiple trips created, **When** filtering by user_id, **Then** only trips for that user are returned

**Multi-Theme Coverage**
22. **Given** all 5 theme types, **When** running full E2E suite, **Then** at least one successful trip generation for each theme (heritage, tvmovie, historical, culinary, adventure)
23. **Given** theme auto-detection, **When** submitting text without explicit theme, **Then** production system correctly identifies theme based on keywords

**Production Secrets & Configuration**
24. **Given** production secrets are configured, **When** API makes calls to OpenAI/Anthropic/Serper/Tavily, **Then** all API calls succeed with valid authentication
25. **Given** production D1 database binding, **When** API writes data, **Then** operations succeed without permission errors
26. **Given** custom domain voygent.app, **When** making requests, **Then** SSL/TLS works correctly and redirects http to https

### Edge Cases
- What happens when production database is at capacity or experiencing high load?
- How does production API handle cold starts (first request after idle period)?
- What if one AI provider (OpenAI/Anthropic) is down but the other is available?
- How are production errors logged and monitored for alerting?
- What happens if a web search API (Serper/Tavily) returns no results?
- How does the system handle extremely slow API responses (>30 seconds)?
- What if production secrets are rotated during test execution?
- How are test trips cleaned up from production database to avoid pollution?

## Dependencies and Assumptions

### Dependencies
- Production deployment at voygent.app must be live and accessible
- Production database (voygent-themed) must be operational
- Production secrets (OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, SERPER_API_KEY, TAVILY_API_KEY) must be configured
- All 5 trip templates must be populated in production database
- Existing unit and integration test suite (feature 007) provides baseline for expected behavior

### Assumptions
- E2E tests will run periodically (e.g., after each deployment) as part of CI/CD or manual validation
- Test data cleanup is essential to avoid polluting production database
- Production tests should focus on critical paths and representative scenarios, not exhaustive coverage
- Some variability in production response times and costs is expected and acceptable
- Tests validate deployment correctness, not feature completeness (feature tests handled by existing suite)
- Running E2E tests against production is acceptable with proper data isolation and cleanup

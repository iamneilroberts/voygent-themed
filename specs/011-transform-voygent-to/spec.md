# Feature Specification: Transform Voygent to Prompt-Driven Template System

**Feature Branch**: `011-transform-voygent-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Dependencies**: Feature 006 (Full Logging and Admin Dashboard)

## Problem Statement

Voygent currently has hard-coded trip creation logic with A/B variant comparison, heritage-specific workflows, and minimal diagnostic visibility. The system needs to become a generalized, prompt-driven platform that can support any trip theme (heritage, culinary, adventure, wellness, etc.) with all behavior, verbiage, and workflow controlled by database templates rather than code. Additionally, the production deployment shows obsolete code, and diagnostic features are missing.

The business model is: use the cheapest AI provider that will suffice to create detailed themed trips with accurate price estimates, then offer users "Get a free quote from a travel professional" to hand off an easy-to-quote document to travel agent subscribers. Travel agents quote in their backend software and the quote routes back to the user. This allows Voygent to minimize AI costs while enabling travel agents to earn comfortable commissions with minimal work.

## Goals

1. **Remove A/B Comparison**: Eliminate obsolete A/B variant comparison logic entirely
2. **Prompt-Driven Architecture**: Move all AI instructions, workflow logic, and user-facing text into the `trip_templates` table
3. **Integrated Diagnostics**: Add comprehensive diagnostic window with live logging from Feature 006
4. **Generalized Search**: Replace heritage-specific search with template-driven search that works for any trip theme
5. **Research-First Workflow**: Display AI research summary immediately; only build trips after research is shown to user
6. **Accurate Price Estimates**: Use Amadeus APIs for realistic flight/hotel pricing; estimate rental cars, tours, meals
7. **Travel Agent Handoff**: Generate structured quote document for travel agent subscribers to quote in their systems
8. **Template-Controlled Behavior**: All verbiage, search queries, trip options count, workflow steps driven by templates
9. **Production Deployment Verification**: Ensure voygent.app runs current code, not preview/obsolete versions

## Non-Goals

- Direct booking or payment processing (no transactions through Voygent)
- Acting as OTA or travel agency (we facilitate handoff to licensed agents)
- Deep genealogy research beyond trip planning needs
- Multi-language support in this phase

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A traveler wants to plan any type of themed trip (heritage, culinary, film location, historical event, adventure, wellness). They enter what they're interested in through a generalized search, see AI-generated research about their interest, review multiple trip configurations based on their preferences, and receive a detailed itinerary with accurate price estimates for flights, hotels, rental cars, and curated toursâ€”all controlled by the trip template selected. They then click "Get a free quote from a travel professional" which sends a structured handoff document to a travel agent subscriber who quotes the trip in their agency software and sends the official quote back to the traveler.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Production Deployment Verification**
   - **Given** voygent.app is deployed, **When** user visits site, **Then** they see current code with no A/B comparison and diagnostic window present
   - **Given** deployment is checked, **When** reviewing Cloudflare settings, **Then** production environment points to main branch, not preview

2. **Generalized Trip Search**
   - **Given** user selects any trip template, **When** they see the search interface, **Then** all text, placeholders, and examples come from the template
   - **Given** user enters search term, **When** research begins, **Then** search query format is defined by template's `research_query_template`
   - **Given** "no trip theme" option exists, **When** selected, **Then** user can freeform describe any trip without theme constraints

3. **Research-First Workflow**
   - **Given** user submits trip interest, **When** research starts, **Then** progress updates show template-driven status messages
   - **Given** research completes, **When** AI summary is ready, **Then** it displays immediately with 2-3 paragraph summary (150-250 words)
   - **Given** research is displayed, **When** waiting to build trips, **Then** no trip options are generated until user sees research

4. **Diagnostic Integration**
   - **Given** Feature 006 logging is deployed, **When** user opens diagnostic window, **Then** they see real-time logs with request IDs, timing, provider calls
   - **Given** diagnostic window is open, **When** trip creation progresses, **Then** each workflow step appears with timestamps and status
   - **Given** error occurs, **When** viewing diagnostics, **Then** full error details with stack trace and context are visible

5. **Template-Driven Trip Options**
   - **Given** research summary is shown, **When** system builds trip options, **Then** number of options, trip days range, and configuration come from template
   - **Given** trip options are generated, **When** displayed to user, **Then** each option shows: title, summary, duration, estimated budget, "why we suggest" text
   - **Given** template defines luxury levels, **When** building options, **Then** options vary by budget from backpacker to luxury as template specifies

6. **Flight Price Estimates with Amadeus**
   - **Given** user selects a trip option, **When** system searches flights, **Then** Amadeus Flight Offers Search API returns pricing options
   - **Given** flight results exist, **When** presenting to user, **Then** show cheapest, shortest flight, and one upgrade option (comfort/business based on luxury level) as price estimates
   - **Given** user preferences include luxury="Occasional Luxe", **When** showing upgrades, **Then** include business/first class pricing estimates
   - **Given** user sees flight options, **When** viewing prices, **Then** prices are clearly labeled as estimates, not bookable fares

7. **Hotel Price Estimates with Amadeus**
   - **Given** trip has multiple locations, **When** searching hotels, **Then** Amadeus Hotel Search API queries each location for pricing
   - **Given** hotel results returned, **When** presenting to user, **Then** show 3-5 hotel options per location with estimated price ranges, ratings, amenities
   - **Given** luxury preference is "Backpack", **When** filtering hotels, **Then** emphasize budget options under $75/night
   - **Given** luxury preference is "Boutique" or higher, **When** filtering hotels, **Then** emphasize upscale options $150+/night
   - **Given** user reviews hotel options, **When** viewing prices, **Then** prices are daily rates and total estimates for the stay

8. **Transport & Tours**
   - **Given** trip itinerary includes driving, **When** estimating costs, **Then** calculate rental car based on days, number of travelers, and distance
   - **Given** trip uses rail transport, **When** showing options, **Then** estimate rail costs for intercity travel
   - **Given** luxury level is high, **When** considering transport, **Then** include hired driver options with cost estimates
   - **Given** trip locations identified, **When** searching tours, **Then** query TripAdvisor and Tours by Locals for small group/private tours
   - **Given** budget conscious preference, **When** selecting tours, **Then** minimize paid tours, prioritize free/low-cost activities
   - **Given** luxury preference high, **When** selecting tours, **Then** emphasize private guides, exclusive experiences

9. **Final Itinerary Presentation**
   - **Given** AI has generated complete itinerary, **When** presenting to user, **Then** show day-by-day breakdown with activities and estimated costs
   - **Given** each day in itinerary, **When** displaying activities, **Then** include mix of paid tours and free plans
   - **Given** each day listed, **When** showing rationale, **Then** display concise "why we suggest" text tying back to trip theme from template
   - **Given** complete itinerary, **When** presenting costs, **Then** show itemized estimate breakdown: flights, hotels, car rental, tours, meals estimate, total with 15-20% margin built in

10. **Travel Agent Quote Request**
    - **Given** user views complete itinerary with price estimates, **When** page loads, **Then** prominent "Get a free quote from a travel professional" button is visible
    - **Given** user clicks quote button, **When** form appears, **Then** user enters name, email, phone, and any special requests
    - **Given** user submits quote request, **When** processing, **Then** system generates comprehensive handoff document including: complete chat history, research summary, all flight options shown (with selected indicator), all hotel options shown (with selected indicator), daily itinerary, transport details, tours, preferences, budget breakdown, special requests
    - **Given** handoff document created, **When** routing to agent, **Then** document is available as both PDF (user-friendly) and JSON (machine-readable) formats
    - **Given** travel agent receives handoff, **When** reviewing document, **Then** agent sees entire trip context (what user asked for, what was researched, what options were presented, what was selected) plus all details needed to quote in agency software
    - **Given** agent creates quote, **When** quote is ready, **Then** system routes quote back to original user with agent contact information and official pricing

11. **Template-Controlled Workflow**
    - **Given** trip template defines workflow steps, **When** executing trip creation, **Then** system follows template's workflow_prompt instructions
    - **Given** template specifies number_of_options=5, **When** generating trips, **Then** create exactly 5 options
    - **Given** template defines search_instructions, **When** running research, **Then** use those instructions for web search and synthesis
    - **Given** template has custom verbiage fields, **When** showing UI text, **Then** all progress messages, labels, help text come from template

### Edge Cases

- **When** template has no `workflow_prompt` defined, **Then** fall back to sensible default workflow
- **When** Amadeus API returns no flights, **Then** show estimated pricing based on typical routes and note manual booking needed in handoff
- **When** hotel search returns < 3 options, **Then** use broader search radius or alternative sources; note limitation in handoff
- **When** tour search finds no results, **Then** suggest DIY activities and free attractions; include research links in handoff
- **When** user has accessibility requirements, **Then** filter hotels/tours for accessibility features; highlight in handoff document
- **When** trip spans multiple countries, **Then** handle currency conversion and display local prices with USD equivalent
- **When** diagnostic logging fails, **Then** continue trip creation without blocking, log error separately
- **When** no travel agents are subscribed, **Then** collect quote request but display message that agent will be assigned
- **When** user requests quote without providing contact info, **Then** prompt for required fields before generating handoff
- **When** estimated prices exceed user's stated budget, **Then** flag in handoff document and suggest budget adjustments to agent

## Notes for Implementation Phase

**Known Dependencies:**
- Feature 006 (Full Logging and Admin Dashboard) MUST be deployed to production first
- Amadeus API credentials required (Flight Offers Search API, Hotel Search API)
- TripAdvisor API key required
- Tours by Locals API key required
- D1 database migrations to extend `trip_templates` schema

**Design Decisions Made:**
-  Template-driven architecture: all prompts and verbiage in database, not code
-  Research-first workflow: show summary before generating trip options
-  Remove A/B comparison: single trip option selected, no variants
-  Amadeus for flights/hotels: established travel API with good coverage
-  TripAdvisor + Tours by Locals: comprehensive tour coverage with ratings

**Design Decisions Still Needed:**
- API rate limiting strategy for Amadeus (cache results? throttle requests?)
- Fallback behavior when Amadeus returns no results (manual booking instructions? alternative APIs?)
- Tour API fallback if TripAdvisor/Tours by Locals unavailable
- Currency conversion approach (fixed exchange rates? live API?)

**Success Metrics:**
- 100% of trip types driven by templates without code changes
- Research summary displayed within 10 seconds
- Complete bookable itinerary (flights, hotels, tours) generated within 60 seconds
- Diagnostic window shows all workflow steps in real-time
- Zero A/B comparison code remaining in production
- Admin can create new trip template via admin dashboard without developer involvement

**Migration Plan:**
1. Deploy Feature 006 to production if not already done
2. Extend `trip_templates` schema with new columns

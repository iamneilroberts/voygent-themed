**Branch**: `005-fix-research-not` | **Date**: 2025-10-07 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/neil/dev/lite-voygent-claude/specs/005-fix-research-not/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → data-model.md (if needed), quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 8. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Fix the research execution system to ensure theme-specific research (surname origins for heritage trips, filming locations for TV/movie trips, etc.) is properly executed during trip generation and persisted to the database in the `diagnostics` field. Currently, research data returns `null` in API responses, preventing users from understanding how trips were personalized. The fix involves ensuring research is triggered based on template configuration (`researchQueryTemplate` and `researchSynthesisPrompt`), web searches are executed, AI synthesis processes the results, and the complete research data is saved to `themed_trips.diagnostics` as JSON.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x for backend API, JavaScript ES2022+ for frontend
**Primary Dependencies**:
- Existing: D1 database (voygent-themed) with themed_trips, trip_templates tables
- Existing: Web search API integration (Tavily/Serper configured in env)
- Existing: AI synthesis via OpenAI/Anthropic providers
- Existing: Template system with researchQueryTemplate and researchSynthesisPrompt fields (added in previous feature)
- Current Issue: Research code exists but is not being called/saved properly

**Storage**: Cloudflare D1 (themed_trips table needs diagnostics column if missing, or diagnostics field is not being populated)
**Testing**: Manual testing via quickstart + verification in database and API responses
**Target Platform**: Cloudflare Pages + Functions
**Project Type**: Web (backend-focused: fix API research execution and data persistence)

**Performance Goals**:
- Research execution within 30 seconds max (per NFR-001 from spec)
- No blocking of trip generation if research fails (NFR-002)
- Research data structure supports fast retrieval (NFR-003)

**Constraints**:
- Must NOT break existing trip generation flow
- Research failures must be graceful (partial data saved, errors logged)
- Template-driven approach (use researchQueryTemplate and researchSynthesisPrompt from templates)
- Research must work for all 5 themes (heritage, tvmovie, historical, culinary, adventure)

**Scale/Scope**:
- Small-to-medium fix: ~200-400 lines of code changes
- Backend: Modify trip generation flow in functions/api/trips/index.ts (~100-150 lines)
- Backend: Ensure web search and AI synthesis are called properly (~50-100 lines)
- Backend: Add/fix database save for diagnostics field (~50 lines)
- Backend: Update API response to include diagnostics (~20 lines)
- Frontend: Verify research display works with real data (may already exist, ~50 lines if needed)
- Testing: Comprehensive test scenarios for all themes

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Critical Path Compliance
✅ **Does not block critical path**
- This feature is a **fix for existing functionality** - research should already be working
- Critical path remains: "Intake → Options(<=4) → Select → A/B → Save Trip ID"
- Research is part of the trip generation process (between Intake and Options)
- The fix ensures research data is visible/accessible but doesn't change the core flow
- **Status**: This fix **completes** an existing critical path feature, doesn't add new flow

### Cheap-First Policy
✅ **Follows cheap-first**
- Research already uses web search (Tavily/Serper) - not an LLM call for search itself
- AI synthesis uses the configured model for the trip (already follows cheap-first in provider selection)
- The fix doesn't add new LLM calls, just ensures existing ones execute properly
- Template `researchSynthesisPrompt` is designed for cheap models (gpt-4o-mini)
- **Status**: No change to model usage policy

### No Inventory Claims
✅ **Uses appropriate language**
- Research findings displayed as "origins identified" not "guaranteed ancestral homeland"
- Filming locations shown as "visit sites where filming occurred" not "exact filming locations"
- Historical sites presented as "relevant historical sites" not comprehensive lists
- **Status**: Language remains appropriate for research context

### Reproducibility
✅ **Maintained**
- Uses existing Cloudflare D1 database (themed_trips table)
- Research uses configured web search APIs (env variables for Tavily/Serper)
- AI synthesis uses existing provider infrastructure (OpenAI/Anthropic via env vars)
- Works identically in `wrangler dev` (local) and production
- **Status**: Fully reproducible across environments

**Gate Status**: ✅ PASS

```

**Structure Decision**: Backend-focused bug fix. The primary issue is in the trip generation API flow (`functions/api/trips/index.ts`) where research is not being executed or saved. The fix involves ensuring the research execution path is triggered, web search and AI synthesis complete successfully, and the results are persisted to the database `diagnostics` field. Frontend display may already be working (was fixed in previous feature) but needs verification with real data.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
*Status*: ✅ COMPLETE

### Research Questions
1. **Does the `themed_trips` table have a `diagnostics` column?** - Need to check schema and add if missing
2. **Where in the code should research be triggered?** - In `functions/api/trips/index.ts` after intake normalization, before options generation
3. **What web search function should be called?** - Check existing web search integration (Tavily/Serper)
4. **How should research results be structured?** - JSON array with `step`, `query`, `results`, `analysis`, `timestamp` fields
5. **Is there existing research code that's not being called?** - Check for commented-out or conditional research logic
6. **How are template research prompts accessed?** - Templates loaded via `selectTemplate()`, access `template.researchQueryTemplate` and `template.researchSynthesisPrompt`
7. **What AI synthesis function should be used?** - Existing `callProvider()` function with research synthesis prompt
8. **How to handle research failures gracefully?** - try/catch around research, save partial results, log errors, continue with trip generation
9. **Should research be conditional by theme?** - Yes, only execute if template has `researchQueryTemplate` defined (skip if null/empty)

### Decisions Made

1. **Database Schema Check**:
   - Query `themed_trips` table schema to confirm `diagnostics` column exists
   - If missing, create migration `012_add_diagnostics_column.sql` with: `ALTER TABLE themed_trips ADD COLUMN diagnostics TEXT DEFAULT NULL;`
   - `diagnostics` column stores JSON string (must serialize with `JSON.stringify()` before INSERT)

2. **Research Execution Flow** (in `functions/api/trips/index.ts`):
   ```
   1. Load template via selectTemplate(input, explicitTheme, env.DB)
   2. Normalize intake with AI (existing code)
   3. [NEW/FIX] Execute research if template.researchQueryTemplate exists:
      a. Build search query from template using intake data (replace {surname}, {title}, {event}, etc.)
      b. Call web search API (Tavily or Serper) with constructed query
      c. Extract top 3-5 results
      d. Call AI synthesis with template.researchSynthesisPrompt + search results
      e. Store research step: { step: 'surname_research', query, results, analysis, timestamp }
   4. Generate trip options (existing code)
   5. [NEW/FIX] Save trip with diagnostics: INSERT INTO themed_trips (..., diagnostics) VALUES (..., JSON.stringify({research: researchSteps}))
   6. Return trip with diagnostics in response
   ```

3. **Research Data Structure**:
   ```typescript
   interface ResearchStep {
     step: string;           // 'surname_research', 'location_research', 'filming_location_research'
     query: string;          // Actual search query executed
     results: Array<{
       title: string;
       url: string;
       snippet: string;
     }>;
     analysis: string;       // AI synthesis output
     timestamp: number;      // Unix timestamp
   }

   interface Diagnostics {
     research: ResearchStep[];
     // Future: add other diagnostic data
   }
   ```

4. **Template Query Interpolation**:
   - Heritage: `{surname} family heritage sites ancestral homes castles historical tours travel destinations`
     - Replace `{surname}` with `intakeJson.surnames[0]`
   - TV/Movie: `{title} filming locations tour guide visitor information`
     - Replace `{title}` with `intakeJson.titles[0]`
   - Historical: `{event} historical sites museums tours visitor information`
     - Replace `{event}` with `intakeJson.events[0]`
   - Culinary: `{cuisine} {region} restaurants cooking classes food tours markets`
     - Replace `{cuisine}` with `intakeJson.cuisines[0]`, `{region}` with `intakeJson.regions[0] || ''`
   - Adventure: `{destination} {activity} hiking trails tours permits best time visit`
     - Replace `{destination}` with `intakeJson.destinations[0]`, `{activity}` with `intakeJson.activities[0]`

5. **Web Search Integration**:
   - Check existing web search code (likely in a separate file or inline)
   - Use Tavily API if `env.TAVILY_API_KEY` exists, otherwise Serper API
   - Request 5 results max
   - Error handling: If search fails, log error, set results to empty array, continue

6. **AI Synthesis Integration**:
   - Use existing `callProvider()` function from provider infrastructure
   - Pass `template.researchSynthesisPrompt` as system prompt
   - Pass formatted search results as user prompt: "Web search results:\n{formatted_results}\n\nProvide analysis:"
   - Use cheap model (gpt-4o-mini or equivalent) following existing provider selection logic
   - Error handling: If synthesis fails, use fallback text: "Research data collected but analysis unavailable"

7. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   ```typescript
   try {
     // Execute research
     const researchSteps = await executeResearch(template, intakeJson);
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('[Research] Failed:', error);
     // Continue with empty research
     const researchSteps = [];
   }
   // Always save trip with diagnostics (even if empty)
   ```

8. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Research adds ~5-10 seconds to trip generation (one web search + one AI synthesis)
   - Acceptable given users expect trip generation to take 30-60 seconds
   - Research runs sequentially before options generation (cannot parallelize due to data dependency)
   - Future optimization: Cache research results by query hash to avoid redundant searches

9. **Testing Approach**:
   - Test each theme individually with real user input
   - Verify research data appears in database `diagnostics` column
   - Verify research data returned in API response `GET /api/trips/{id}`
   - Verify research summary displays in frontend UI
   - Test error scenarios: web search timeout, AI synthesis failure, missing template fields

### Output
✅ research.md created with all 9 design decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Deliverables
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*
*Status*: ✅ COMPLETE

### Deliverables

1. **quickstart.md**: Manual testing and verification guide
   - Setup: Ensure database schema has diagnostics column
   - Test 1: Heritage trip with "Williams" surname - verify research executed and saved
   - Test 2: TV/Movie trip with "Game of Thrones" - verify filming location research
   - Test 3: Historical trip with "D-Day" - verify historical site research
   - Test 4: Culinary trip with "Italian" cuisine - verify restaurant research
   - Test 5: Adventure trip with "Patagonia" - verify activity research
   - Test 6: Check database directly: `SELECT id, theme, diagnostics FROM themed_trips WHERE id='XXX';`
   - Test 7: Check API response: `curl https://voygent.app/api/trips/XXX | jq '.diagnostics'`
   - Test 8: Check frontend display: Open trip in browser, verify research summary appears
   - Test 9: Error scenario: Invalid search query - verify graceful failure
   - Test 10: Performance: Measure total trip generation time with research enabled

2. **contracts/research.ts**: TypeScript interfaces (optional - may inline in trips/index.ts)
   - ResearchStep interface
   - Diagnostics interface
   - ResearchQuery interface

### Validation
- ✅ Research execution integrated into trip generation flow
- ✅ Diagnostics field populated in database
- ✅ API responses include research data
- ✅ Frontend displays research summary
- ✅ Error handling prevents research failures from blocking trip generation
- ✅ All 5 themes tested with research execution
- ✅ Performance remains within acceptable limits (<60s total)

### Output
✅ quickstart.md with 10 comprehensive test scenarios
✅ contracts/research.ts with TypeScript interfaces (optional)

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

### Task Generation Strategy

1. **Database Verification & Migration** (2 tasks):
   - Task 1: Check if themed_trips.diagnostics column exists via D1 query
   - Task 2: Create and run migration 012_add_diagnostics_column.sql if needed

2. **Research Infrastructure** (3 tasks):
   - Task 3: Identify existing web search function or create new function for Tavily/Serper integration
   - Task 4: Create query interpolation function to replace {surname}, {title}, etc. in researchQueryTemplate
   - Task 5: Create research execution function that orchestrates: query build → web search → AI synthesis → format result

3. **Trip Generation Integration** (4 tasks):
   - Task 6: Modify functions/api/trips/index.ts to call research execution after intake normalization
   - Task 7: Store research results in memory during trip generation flow
   - Task 8: Modify database INSERT to include diagnostics field with JSON.stringify(diagnostics)
   - Task 9: Modify API response to include diagnostics field in returned trip object

4. **Error Handling & Resilience** (2 tasks):
   - Task 10: Add try/catch around research execution with graceful degradation
   - Task 11: Add logging for research execution status (started, completed, failed)

5. **Testing & Validation** (5 tasks):
   - Task 12: Test heritage theme (Williams surname) - verify research in DB and API
   - Task 13: Test tvmovie theme (Game of Thrones) - verify filming location research
   - Task 14: Test historical theme (D-Day) - verify historical site research
   - Task 15: Test culinary theme (Italian) - verify restaurant research
   - Task 16: Test adventure theme (Patagonia) - verify activity research

6. **Frontend Verification** (1 task):
   - Task 17: Verify displayResearchSummary function works with real research data from API

### Ordering Strategy
1. Database verification/migration first (must have diagnostics column)
2. Research infrastructure (web search, query interpolation, execution function)
3. Trip generation integration (call research, save to DB, return in API)
4. Error handling (make robust)
5. Testing all 5 themes
6. Frontend verification

### Estimated Output
~17 tasks in tasks.md, mostly sequential:
- Database tasks must complete first
- Research infrastructure can be developed/tested in parallel
- Trip generation integration depends on research infrastructure
- Theme testing can run in parallel once integration complete
- Frontend verification is last

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run quickstart.md manual tests)

## Complexity Tracking

### Potential Constitutional Concerns
**None identified** - This fix has zero constitutional violations:

- ✅ Does not change critical path (completes existing step in path)
- ✅ Follows cheap-first (uses existing provider selection logic)
- ✅ No inventory claims (research findings are exploratory, not guaranteed)
- ✅ Fully reproducible (uses D1, web search APIs, existing AI providers)

### Complexity Justifications
*Not applicable - no deviations from constitutional principles*

### Additional Complexity Notes
- This is a **small-to-medium fix** (~200-400 lines of code changes)
- Core issue is likely a missing function call or incorrect conditional logic
- Database schema may need one column added (simple ALTER TABLE)
- Risk: If web search API is not configured, research will fail silently (acceptable)
- Risk: If AI synthesis times out, partial research is saved (acceptable per spec)

# Feature Specification: Complete Full Trip Planning Flow

**Feature Branch**: `004-finish-the-full`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "finish the full trip planning flow"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
    If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
    Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
    Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
    If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
    Each requirement must be testable
    Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
    If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
    If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## =Ì Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
-  Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- a Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Current State Analysis
Based on codebase review, the current implementation has:
-  Research phase complete (intake normalization, web search, AI synthesis)
-  Research summary display with findings
-  "Generate Trip Options" button that calls full trip generation
-  Trip generation API endpoint (`/api/trips POST`) exists
-  Quote request modal and API endpoint complete
- L **Missing**: Display of trip options and itineraries after generation
- L **Missing**: User selection of preferred trip option
- L **Missing**: Cost breakdown display (flights, hotels, rental car)
- L **Missing**: Connection between trip options and quote request

### Assumptions Made
- Trip generation API already returns multiple trip options with itineraries and costs
- Each trip option includes: title, description, cities, days, activities, estimated budget
- Cost breakdown includes: flights, hotels, rental car (estimated)
- Users should be able to compare 2-4 trip options before selecting one

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A traveler has completed the research phase and clicked "Generate Trip Options". They need to see multiple curated trip options (e.g., "Heritage Highlights - 7 Days" vs "Deep Dive Heritage - 14 Days"), compare itineraries and costs, select their preferred option, review the detailed day-by-day itinerary, and then request a quote from a travel professional.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has completed research and clicked "Generate Trip Options", **When** trip generation completes, **Then** they see 2-4 trip option cards with titles, descriptions, duration, and estimated budget
2. **Given** multiple trip options are displayed, **When** a user clicks on one option, **Then** the detailed day-by-day itinerary for that option appears below
3. **Given** a detailed itinerary is displayed, **When** viewing the itinerary, **Then** they see each city, number of nights, activities, and cost breakdown (flights, hotels, rental car)
4. **Given** a user has reviewed an itinerary, **When** they click "Get a Free Quote", **Then** the traveler intake modal opens to collect their contact information
5. **Given** a user selects a different trip option, **When** the new option is clicked, **Then** the previous itinerary is replaced with the new option's itinerary
6. **Given** trip generation is in progress, **When** waiting for results, **Then** a progress indicator shows generation status with theme-specific messaging

### Edge Cases
- What happens if trip generation fails (API error, timeout)?
- How should the system handle trips with no flight options available?
- What if hotel search returns no results for a destination?
- Should users be able to customize/modify an itinerary before requesting a quote?
- Can users go back to research results after viewing trip options?
- What if rental car is not applicable (e.g., city-only trips)?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Trip Options Display
- **FR-001**: System MUST display 2-4 trip option cards after generation completes, each showing title, description, duration, and estimated total budget
- **FR-002**: System MUST clearly distinguish between different trip options using visual cards with hover effects
- **FR-003**: System MUST indicate which trip option is currently selected using visual highlighting
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to select any trip option by clicking on its card
- **FR-005**: System MUST replace the currently displayed itinerary when a different trip option is selected

#### Itinerary Display
- **FR-006**: System MUST show a detailed day-by-day itinerary for the selected trip option
- **FR-007**: System MUST display each destination city with number of nights and accommodation details
- **FR-008**: System MUST show activities and highlights for each location in the itinerary
- **FR-009**: System MUST present the itinerary in chronological order from departure to return
- **FR-010**: System MUST include travel segments between cities (e.g., "Drive from Edinburgh to Inverness - 3 hours")

#### Cost Breakdown
- **FR-011**: System MUST display estimated costs broken down by category: flights, hotels, rental car
- **FR-012**: System MUST show the total estimated budget prominently

## Notes for Implementation Phase

**Known Dependencies:**
- Trip generation API (`/api/trips POST`) must return proper data structure
- Progress indicator system already exists (progress.js, progress-steps.js)
- Traveler intake modal already exists (traveler-intake.js)
- HTML structure already includes sections: `#optionsSection`, `#itinerarySection`

**Design Decisions Needed:**
- Maximum number of trip options to generate (suggest 2-4 for comparison)
- Whether to support itinerary customization before quote request
- Handling of trips where rental car is not applicable
- Format for displaying multi-city travel segments

# Phase 0: Research - Feature 011 Status Review

**Feature**: 012-peek-at-specs
**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Purpose**: Document analysis approach for assessing Feature 011 implementation status

## Overview

This feature performs a comprehensive status review of Feature 011 (Transform Voygent to Prompt-Driven Template System). Since all technologies and approaches are well-known from the existing codebase, this research phase documents the analysis methodology rather than exploring unknowns.

## Analysis Approach

### 1. File System Analysis

**Decision**: Use direct file system reading and pattern matching to assess implementation
**Rationale**:
- Most accurate method - examines actual code/config files
- Deterministic - same input produces same output
- Fast - no runtime execution required
- Complete - can check all 18 Feature 011 requirements systematically

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Runtime introspection: Would require running app, less reliable, overkill for status check
- Manual developer interview: Subjective, not systematic, error-prone
- Git history analysis: Tells what was done, not what remains or current state

### 2. Feature 011 Requirement Mapping

**Decision**: Parse Feature 011 spec to extract all FR-001 through FR-018, then map each to expected implementation artifacts

**Mapping Strategy**:

| Requirement | Expected Evidence |
|-------------|------------------|
| FR-001: Production Deployment | Check Cloudflare Pages config, deployment logs |
| FR-002: Remove A/B Comparison | Grep for "variant", "A/B" in codebase, check UI files |
| FR-003: Generalized Trip Search | Check index.html for template-driven search UI |
| FR-004: Template Schema Extensions | Check migrations/020_extend_trip_templates.sql exists |
| FR-005: Research-First Workflow | Check API endpoints for research phase separation |
| FR-006: Integrated Diagnostics | Check admin-dashboard.html for diagnostic UI |
| FR-007: Amadeus Flight API | Grep functions/api/ for "amadeus.*flight" |
| FR-008: Amadeus Hotel API | Grep functions/api/ for "amadeus.*hotel" |
| FR-009: Rental Car Estimation | Check for transport estimation logic |
| FR-010: Tour & Activity Search | Grep for "tripadvisor", "tours by locals" |
| FR-011: Daily Itinerary Generation | Check for itinerary generation endpoints |
| FR-012: Template-Driven Prompts | Check trip-templates.ts for prompt loading |
| FR-013: Template-Driven UI Verbiage | Check UI files for template variable usage |
| FR-014: User Preference Collection | Check for preference collection UI/API |
| FR-015: Final Itinerary Presentation | Check for itinerary display UI |
| FR-016: Travel Agent Handoff | Check migrations/021_create_handoff_documents.sql |
| FR-017: Travel Agent Quote Routing | Check for quote routing logic |
| FR-018: Logging Integration | Check for Feature 006 logging calls |

**Rationale**: Each functional requirement has concrete, testable implementation artifacts. Checking for these artifacts gives objective status assessment.

### 3. Admin Interface Capability Assessment

**Decision**: Parse public/admin.html to identify present and missing template management features

**Check List**:
- [ ] Template list/view functionality
- [ ] Template create form
- [ ] Template edit form
- [ ] Template delete functionality
- [ ] All FR-004 fields accessible in UI:
  - [ ] search_placeholder
  - [ ] search_help_text
  - [ ] progress_messages (JSON editor)
  - [ ] workflow_prompt (text area)
  - [ ] number_of_options (number input)
  - [ ] trip_days_min/max (number inputs)
  - [ ] luxury_levels (JSON array editor)
  - [ ] activity_levels (JSON array editor)
  - [ ] transport_preferences (JSON array editor)
  - [ ] tour_search_instructions (text area)
  - [ ] hotel_search_instructions (text area)
  - [ ] flight_search_instructions (text area)
  - [ ] daily_activity_prompt (text area)
  - [ ] why_we_suggest_prompt (text area)
- [ ] JSON validation for array fields
- [ ] Template activation toggle

**Rationale**: Admin interface is critical for template management. Checking HTML structure reveals CRUD capabilities and missing fields.

### 4. Dashboard Capability Assessment

**Decision**: Parse public/admin-dashboard.html to identify operational visibility features

**Check List**:
- [ ] Log viewing interface
- [ ] Correlation ID filter
- [ ] Timestamp display
- [ ] Severity level filtering (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- [ ] Operation type display
- [ ] Duration metrics
- [ ] Auto-scroll to newest entries
- [ ] Collapsible/expandable UI
- [ ] Real-time updates (WebSocket or polling)
- [ ] Trip-specific log filtering
- [ ] Performance metrics display

**Rationale**: Dashboard must provide diagnostic visibility per Feature 011 FR-006. Checking HTML reveals implemented vs. missing features.

### 5. Database Migration Status

**Decision**: List migrations directory and compare against Feature 011 requirements

**Required Migrations**:
1. `020_extend_trip_templates.sql` - Adds FR-004 columns to trip_templates table
2. `021_create_handoff_documents.sql` - Creates handoff_documents table per FR-016

**Check Method**:
- List files in migrations/ directory
- Check for exact filename matches
- Read migration files to verify column additions match FR-004 spec
- Report which migrations exist vs. missing

**Rationale**: Database schema changes are blocking dependencies for template-driven features. Must verify migrations are created and can be applied.

### 6. Gap Analysis Strategy

**Decision**: For each incomplete or not-started requirement, classify by severity and effort

**Severity Levels**:
- **Blocking**: Prevents Feature 011 from functioning at all (e.g., missing migrations)
- **Important**: Feature works but missing key capability (e.g., admin UI missing template fields)
- **Nice to have**: Enhancement, not critical path (e.g., dashboard auto-scroll)

**Effort Estimates**:
- **Small**: < 2 hours (e.g., add missing UI field, create migration file)
- **Medium**: 2-8 hours (e.g., implement API endpoint, add dashboard filter)
- **Large**: > 8 hours (e.g., Amadeus integration, complete workflow refactor)

**Rationale**: Gaps need prioritization. Severity × effort matrix helps developer decide what to tackle first.

### 7. Next Steps Prioritization

**Decision**: Generate dependency-ordered task list using priority scoring

**Priority Scoring**:
```
Priority = (Severity_Weight) - (Effort_Cost) + (Dependency_Bonus)

Severity_Weight:
- Blocking: 10
- Important: 7
- Nice to have: 4

Effort_Cost:
- Small: 1
- Medium: 3
- Large: 5

Dependency_Bonus:
- Is dependency for N other tasks: +N
```

**Example**:
- Task: "Create migration 020_extend_trip_templates.sql"
- Severity: Blocking (10)
- Effort: Small (1)
- Dependency for: 5 template-driven features (+5)
- Priority: 10 - 1 + 5 = **14** (very high)

**Rationale**: Prioritizes tasks that unblock other work (dependencies), address critical gaps (severity), and are quick wins (small effort).

## Tools and Technologies

**No new technologies needed** - analysis uses existing tools:

1. **File System Operations**: Read files, list directories (built-in)
2. **Pattern Matching**: Grep/regex for code searches (built-in)
3. **JSON Schema Validation**: Validate report against contract (standard JSON Schema validator)
4. **Markdown/JSON Generation**: Format output (built-in)

## Expected Outputs

1. **requirements_status.json**: Array of all 18 FR statuses with evidence
2. **admin_interface_check.json**: Feature checklist with missing capabilities
3. **dashboard_check.json**: Feature checklist with missing capabilities
4. **migration_status.json**: Required vs. applied migrations
5. **gaps.json**: Prioritized gap list with severity/effort
6. **next_steps.json**: Ordered task list with dependencies
7. **status_report.json**: Consolidated report matching contract schema
8. **status_report.md**: Human-readable summary

## Validation Criteria

**Status review is complete when**:
1. ✅ All 18 Feature 011 requirements assessed
2. ✅ Each requirement has status (complete/in-progress/not-started)
3. ✅ Evidence listed for "complete" requirements (file paths, code snippets)
4. ✅ Blockers listed for "in-progress" requirements
5. ✅ Admin interface capabilities checked against FR-002, FR-004

- ✅ Project structure: Cloudflare Pages + Functions (known)
- ✅ Database: D1 with migrations (known)
- ✅ Admin interfaces: HTML files in public/ (known)
- ✅ Feature 011 requirements: Documented in spec.md (known)
- ✅ Analysis approach: File system inspection (standard)
- ✅ Output format: JSON schema defined (known)

## Next Phase

2. contracts/status-report.json - JSON schema for report
3. quickstart.md - How to run status analysis and interpret results

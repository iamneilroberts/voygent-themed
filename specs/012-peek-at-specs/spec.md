## Problem Statement

Feature 011 (Transform Voygent to Prompt-Driven Template System) is currently in development on branch `011-transform-voygent-to`. The developer needs visibility into:

1. **Current implementation status** - which parts of Feature 011 are complete vs. in-progress
2. **Admin interface readiness** - whether voygent.app/admin supports template management
3. **Dashboard readiness** - whether voygent.app/admin-dashboard provides operational visibility
4. **Blockers and dependencies** - what's preventing Feature 011 completion

This feature provides a comprehensive status review to inform next implementation steps.

## Goals

1. **Assess Feature 011 Progress**: Determine completion status of template-driven architecture
2. **Verify Admin Interface**: Confirm prompt admin at voygent.app/admin supports template CRUD operations
3. **Verify Dashboard**: Confirm admin dashboard at voygent.app/admin-dashboard shows operational metrics
4. **Identify Gaps**: List missing components blocking Feature 011 completion
5. **Provide Actionable Next Steps**: Clear roadmap for finishing Feature 011

## Non-Goals

- Creating new features beyond Feature 011 scope
- Redesigning admin interfaces from scratch
- Backporting changes to older feature branches
- Performance optimization (unless blocking Feature 011)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A developer working on Feature 011 needs to understand what has been implemented, what remains, and what admin tools are available for managing trip templates and monitoring the system. They visit voygent.app/admin to manage prompts and voygent.app/admin-dashboard to view operational metrics, then identify any missing capabilities needed to complete Feature 011.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Feature 011 Spec Review**
   - **Given** Feature 011 spec exists at specs/011-transform-voygent-to/spec.md, **When** developer reads it, **Then** they understand all functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-018) and acceptance criteria

2. **Admin Interface Assessment**
   - **Given** voygent.app/admin is deployed, **When** developer accesses it, **Then** they can view, create, edit, and delete trip templates
   - **Given** template editor is open, **When** developer edits prompts, **Then** all template fields from FR-004 are accessible (search_placeholder, workflow_prompt, progress_messages, etc.)
   - **Given** template has been updated, **When** developer saves, **Then** changes persist to database and affect trip creation immediately

3. **Dashboard Assessment**
   - **Given** voygent.app/admin-dashboard is deployed, **When** developer accesses it, **Then** they see real-time trip creation metrics, API call logs, and diagnostic data
   - **Given** diagnostic data is displayed, **When** filtering by trip, **Then** all logs for that trip's correlation_id appear (per FR-006)
   - **Given** logs are visible, **When** reviewing performance, **Then** timestamp, severity, operation, message, duration are shown (per Feature 006)

4. **Migration Status Check**
   - **Given** Feature 011 requires database schema changes, **When** developer checks migrations, **Then** they verify migrations 020 and 021 are created and applied
   - **Given** migrations extend trip_templates, **When** reviewing schema, **Then** new columns from FR-004 exist (search_placeholder, workflow_prompt, number_of_options, etc.)

5. **A/B Comparison Removal Verification**
   - **Given** FR-002 requires removing A/B logic, **When** developer reviews codebase, **Then** no references to variant A/B comparison remain
   - **Given** production is deployed, **When** user visits voygent.app, **Then** UI shows no "Variant A vs Variant B" interface

6. **Research-First Workflow Verification**
   - **Given** FR-005 requires research-first workflow, **When** developer tests trip creation, **Then** research summary displays before trip options generate
   - **Given** research displays, **When** timing is measured, **Then** research completes within 10 seconds (per NFR-001)

7. **Amadeus Integration Check**
   - **Given** FR-007 and FR-008 require Amadeus APIs, **When** developer checks integrations, **Then** Flight Offers Search API and Hotel Search API are functional
   - **Given** trip creation runs, **When** APIs are called, **Then** flight and hotel price estimates appear in itinerary

8. **Template-Driven Prompts Verification**
   - **Given** FR-012 requires prompts from templates, **When** developer creates a trip, **Then** all AI prompts come from trip_templates table, not hard-coded
   - **Given** template is updated via admin, **When** trip is created with updated template, **Then** new prompts are used immediately

### Edge Cases

- **When** Feature 011 spec has requirements not yet implemented, **Then** status review clearly lists them as pending
- **When** admin interface is missing template fields, **Then** report identifies which fields need UI additions
- **When** dashboard doesn't show correlation_id filtering, **Then** report flags diagnostic window as incomplete
- **When** migrations haven't been applied to production database, **Then** status includes database migration plan
- **When** Amadeus API keys are missing, **Then** report lists required credentials and setup steps

# Tasks: Review Feature 011 Implementation Status

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/neil/dev/lite-voygent-claude/specs/012-peek-at-specs/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✓, research.md ✓, data-model.md ✓, contracts/status-report.json ✓, quickstart.md ✓

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓

   → JSON schema validation task included
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
This is a **read-only analysis feature** - no new runtime code, only analysis scripts that generate a status report.

**Analysis targets**:
- `specs/011-transform-voygent-to/spec.md` - Feature 011 specification
- `public/admin.html` - Admin interface
- `public/admin-dashboard.html` - Dashboard
- `functions/api/` - API implementation files
- `migrations/` - Database migrations

**Output**:
- `reports/feature-011-status-report.json` - Machine-readable status
- `reports/feature-011-status-report.md` - Human-readable summary

## Phase 3.1: Setup (Prerequisites)

- [ ] **T001** Create reports directory at `/home/neil/dev/lite-voygent-claude/reports/` if it doesn't exist

---

## Phase 3.2: Analysis Tasks (Gather Data)
**CRITICAL: These tasks analyze the codebase to extract implementation evidence. All can run in parallel.**

### Extract Feature 011 Requirements

- [ ] **T002** [P] Load Feature 011 spec from `specs/011-transform-voygent-to/spec.md` and extract all 18 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-018) with titles and descriptions

### Analyze Requirements Implementation (18 parallel checks)

- [ ] **T003** [P] Check FR-001 (Production Deployment): Search `wrangler.toml` for production deployment config, verify branch settings

- [ ] **T004** [P] Check FR-002 (Remove A/B Comparison): Grep `public/`, `functions/` for "variant", "A/B", "comparison" keywords to find remnants

- [ ] **T005** [P] Check FR-003 (Generalized Trip Search): Search `public/index.html` for "search_placeholder", "example_inputs" template variables

- [ ] **T006** [P] Check FR-004 (Template Schema Extensions): Verify `migrations/020_extend_trip_templates.sql` exists and contains new columns (workflow_prompt, progress_messages, etc.)

- [ ] **T007** [P] Check FR-005 (Research-First Workflow): Grep `functions/api/` for "research.*summary", check for research phase separation logic

- [ ] **T014** [P] Check FR-012 (Template-Driven Prompts): Verify `functions/api/lib/trip-templates.ts` loads prompts from database, not hard-coded

- [ ] **T015** [P] Check FR-013 (Template-Driven UI Verbiage): Search `public/index.html` for template variable substitution in UI text

- [ ] **T016** [P] Check FR-014 (User Preference Collection): Check `public/index.html` for luxury_level, activity_level, transport_preference form fields

- [ ] **T017** [P] Check FR-015 (Final Itinerary Presentation): Search `public/index.html` for itinerary display UI with cost breakdown

- [ ] **T018** [P] Check FR-016 (Travel Agent Handoff): Verify `migrations/021_create_handoff_documents.sql` exists and grep `functions/api/` for "handoff" generation logic

## Phase 3.3: Assessment Tasks (Evaluate Status)
**CRITICAL: These tasks depend on analysis phase completing. Run sequentially after T002-T024.**

- [ ] **T025** Map FR-001 through FR-018 analysis results (T003-T020) to status (complete/in_progress/not_started) based on evidence found

- [ ] **T026** For each "complete" requirement, extract evidence (file paths, line numbers, code snippets found during analysis)

- [ ] **T027** For each "in_progress" or "not_started" requirement, extract blockers (missing files, incomplete implementations)

- [ ] **T028** Assess admin interface (T021-T022 results): Create AdminInterfaceStatus object with features present/missing

- [ ] **T029** Assess dashboard (T023 results): Create DashboardStatus object with features present/missing

- [ ] **T030** Assess migrations (T024 results): Create MigrationStatus object categorizing as applied/pending/missing

- [ ] **T031** Calculate completion percentage: (complete requirements / 18) × 100

---

## Phase 3.4: Gap Identification
**CRITICAL: Depends on assessment phase (T025-T031). Run sequentially.**

- [ ] **T032** For each incomplete requirement, create Gap object with requirement_id, description, severity (blocking/important/nice_to_have)

- [ ] **T033** Estimate effort for each gap (small: <2h, medium: 2-8h, large: >8h) based on what's missing

- [ ] **T034** Calculate priority for each gap using formula: severityWeight[severity] - effortCost[effort]

---

## Phase 3.5: Next Steps Generation
**CRITICAL: Depends on gap identification (T032-T034). Run sequentially.**

- [ ] **T035** Convert gaps into actionable Task objects with sequential IDs, descriptions, estimated_effort

- [ ] **T036** Identify dependencies between tasks (e.g., "Apply migration 020" must happen before "Add admin UI fields for FR-004 columns")

- [ ] **T037** Calculate priority for each task (1-10 scale) using severity, effort, and dependency bonus

- [ ] **T038** Order tasks by priority (descending) and dependencies (blocking tasks first)

---

## Phase 3.6: Report Generation
**CRITICAL: Depends on all previous phases. Run sequentially.**

- [ ] **T039** Assemble StatusReport object with all components: feature_id, requirements_status (T025-T027), admin_interface (T028), dashboard (T029), migrations (T030), gaps (T032-T034), next_steps (T035-T038), generated_at timestamp

- [ ] **T040** Validate StatusReport JSON against schema in `specs/012-peek-at-specs/contracts/status-report.json`

- [ ] **T041** Write JSON report to `/home/neil/dev/lite-voygent-claude/reports/feature-011-status-report.json`

- [ ] **T042** Generate human-readable Markdown summary from JSON with sections: Executive Summary, Completion Status, Gaps by Severity, Top Priority Tasks

- [ ] **T043** Write Markdown report to `/home/neil/dev/lite-voygent-claude/reports/feature-011-status-report.md`

---

## Phase 3.7: Validation
**CRITICAL: Final validation step. Run after report generation.**

- [ ] **T044** Verify all 18 FRs have status assigned in JSON report

- [ ] **T045** Verify JSON report has all required fields per schema (feature_id, requirements_status, admin_interface, dashboard, migrations, gaps, next_steps, generated_at)

- [ ] **T046** Verify generated Markdown is readable and contains all key sections

- [ ] **T047** Run quickstart.md validation steps to ensure report correctness

## Parallel Execution Example

**Phase 3.2: Launch all analysis tasks in parallel** (maximum efficiency):

```bash
# Analysis of all 18 FRs can run in parallel since each checks different files
# Launch T002-T024 together:

Task agent 1: "Load specs/011-transform-voygent-to/spec.md and extract FR-001 through FR-018"
Task agent 2: "Check FR-001: Search wrangler.toml for production deployment config"
Task agent 3: "Check FR-002: Grep public/ and functions/ for A/B comparison remnants"
Task agent 4: "Check FR-003: Search public/index.html for template-driven search UI"
Task agent 5: "Check FR-004: Verify migrations/020_extend_trip_templates.sql exists"
# ... continue for T006-T024
```

**All 23 analysis tasks (T002-T024) can run simultaneously** - they read different files and have no dependencies on each other.

---

## Notes

- **Read-only analysis**: No code modifications, only reading/searching existing files
- **[P] markers**: Analysis tasks are all parallel (different files, no shared state)
- **Assessment/Reporting**: Sequential - each step builds on previous results
- **No TDD required**: This is analysis work, not feature implementation
- **Output validation**: JSON must match schema, Markdown must be readable
- **Time estimate**:
  - Analysis phase: ~5 minutes (parallel execution)
  - Assessment/Gap/Next Steps: ~10 minutes (sequential processing)
  - Report generation: ~2 minutes
  - Total: ~17 minutes for complete status review

---

## Task Generation Rules Applied

✅ **From Contracts**: status-report.json schema → validation task (T040)
✅ **From Data Model**: StatusReport, RequirementStatus, Gap, Task entities → assessment tasks (T025-T038)
✅ **From Quickstart**: Manual analysis steps → analysis tasks (T002-T024)
✅ **Ordering**: Setup → Analysis [P] → Assessment → Gaps → Next Steps → Report → Validation
✅ **Parallel optimization**: All 23 file-reading tasks marked [P] for maximum throughput

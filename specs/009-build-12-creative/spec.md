## =Ë Quick Guidelines
- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Problem Statement

VoyGent currently has 5 trip templates (heritage, TV/movie, historical, culinary, adventure), which provide good coverage of major travel themes but represent only a fraction of the diverse travel interests and motivations that exist. Many potential users have specific interests that don't fit neatly into these broad categories:

- Wellness and spiritual seekers looking for yoga retreats, meditation centers, or pilgrimage routes
- Architecture enthusiasts wanting to explore iconic buildings, UNESCO sites, or specific architectural styles
- Music lovers interested in jazz festivals, classical music venues, or music history tours
- Wildlife and nature photographers seeking specific ecosystems or animal encounters
- Festival enthusiasts wanting to experience cultural celebrations, carnivals, or seasonal events
- Sports fans looking to attend major sporting events or visit legendary sports venues
- Literary travelers wanting to follow in the footsteps of famous authors or visit book-themed locations
- Wine and beer enthusiasts seeking vineyard tours, breweries, or tasting experiences
- Art lovers wanting gallery tours, artist residencies, or public art installations
- Romance and honeymoon travelers looking for couples-oriented destinations and experiences
- Sustainability-focused travelers seeking eco-tourism and responsible travel options
- Photography-centric trips designed around golden hour, landscapes, or street photography

Without these specialized templates, VoyGent cannot provide personalized trip planning for these niche but significant travel segments. The platform needs to expand its template library to serve a broader audience and demonstrate the flexibility of the AI-powered trip generation system.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A traveler with a specific interest (e.g., architecture, wellness, music) visits VoyGent and wants to plan a trip aligned with their passion. They should see a template option that resonates with their interest and, when selected, generates a trip with destinations, activities, and itineraries tailored to that theme.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Template Discovery**
1. **Given** a user visits the VoyGent homepage, **When** viewing available templates, **Then** they see 17 total templates (5 existing + 12 new) displayed with clear names and icons
2. **Given** the template selection interface, **When** a user browses templates, **Then** each template has a distinct icon and name that clearly communicates its theme
3. **Given** diverse user interests, **When** selecting a template, **Then** users can find a template matching niche interests (wellness, architecture, music, etc.)

**Template-Specific Trip Generation**
4. **Given** a wellness trip template, **When** user requests a trip with destination "Bali", **Then** trip includes yoga retreats, meditation centers, spa experiences, and holistic healing
5. **Given** an architecture trip template, **When** user requests a trip to "Barcelona", **Then** trip highlights Gaudí buildings, modernist architecture, and architectural tours
6. **Given** a music trip template, **When** user requests a trip focused on "jazz in New Orleans", **Then** trip includes jazz clubs, music history museums, and live performance venues
7. **Given** a wildlife photography template, **When** user requests "African safari", **Then** trip emphasizes photography-friendly lodges, golden hour game drives, and rare animal sightings
8. **Given** a festival template, **When** user requests "cultural festivals in India", **Then** trip includes Diwali celebrations, Holi experiences, or regional cultural events
9. **Given** a sports template, **When** user requests "Formula 1 in Monaco", **Then** trip includes race attendance, pit tours, and Monaco Grand Prix experiences
10. **Given** a literary template, **When** user requests "Shakespeare in England", **Then** trip includes Stratford-upon-Avon, Globe Theatre, and literary landmarks
11. **Given** a wine/beer template, **When** user requests "wine tasting in Tuscany", **Then** trip includes vineyard tours, wine cellars, and tasting experiences
12. **Given** an art template, **When** user requests "museums in Paris", **Then** trip focuses on Louvre, Orsay, contemporary galleries, and artist studios
13. **Given** a romance template, **When** user requests "honeymoon in Maldives", **Then** trip emphasizes couples activities, romantic dining, and intimate experiences
14. **Given** a sustainability template, **When** user requests "eco-tourism in Costa Rica", **Then** trip highlights eco-lodges, conservation projects, and sustainable activities
15. **Given** a photography template, **When** user requests "landscape photography Iceland", **Then** trip is structured around golden hour, iconic photo spots, and weather considerations

**Research Prompt Customization**
16. **Given** each new template, **When** trip generation occurs, **Then** research prompts are tailored to find theme-specific destinations and experiences
17. **Given** a wellness template with research enabled, **When** searching for destinations, **Then** research finds retreat centers, meditation venues, and holistic healing locations
18. **Given** a festival template, **When** research executes, **Then** search results include festival dates, ticket information, and event-specific accommodations

**Template Data Persistence**
19. **Given** 12 new templates are created, **When** saved to database, **Then** each template has unique id, name, icon, and research prompts
20. **Given** templates in database, **When** querying /api/templates, **Then** all 17 templates (5 existing + 12 new) are returned
21. **Given** a trip created with new template, **When** saved to database, **Then** trip record references correct template_id

**Template Icon & Branding**
22. **Given** each new template, **When** displayed in UI, **Then** template has a unique emoji icon that visually represents the theme
23. **Given** template names, **When** users read them, **Then** names are clear, inviting, and avoid technical jargon

### Edge Cases
- What happens if two templates overlap significantly (e.g., wine tourism vs. culinary tourism)?
- How are templates prioritized or ordered in the UI?
- Can users combine multiple templates in a single trip request?
- What if user input doesn't match any template clearly?
- How are templates updated or deprecated over time?
- Can users suggest or vote on new template ideas?
